I select essayists as they are more consistent in their prose --you read their prose not their books. This list does not include authors you read for their philosophy.
   * Walter Benjamin (Arendt:"he thought poetically")
   * Cyril Connoly (the finest literary sensibility)
   * Gaston Bachelard (another aesthetic thinker)
   * Claude Levi-Strauss (Tristes tropiques was initially meant to be a novel)
   * Roland Barthes
   * Emil Cioran
   * Paul Celan
   * Isaiah Berlin
   * George Santayana
   * John Gray (the philosopher not the pop psychologist -a true genuinely non-nonsense philosopher)
   * Ernest Renan

### 26 (WED)
> My recommendation is to emphasize action and experimentation. Invite people to do things. Sign up. Go on outings. Dabble with new activities, from yoga, to reading, to making. Keep busy, and reflect on what seems to resonate.
>
> The people who succeed with the transformation to digital minimalism tends to be those who get serious about this exploration step. Those who instead treat the 30 days as only a detox, tend to just revert to their prior behavior with little improvement to show for it.

> The definition of solitude I use actually comes from another book called Lead Yourself First, and it defines solitude as time spent free from inputs from other minds. If you're reading something or listening to something you're not in a state of solitude, as your mind is reacting to another mind. On the other hand, if you're just alone with your own thoughts, you are in a state of solitude, regardless of whether or not you are around other people at the moment.

> We have a lot of evidence to suggest that we need solitude on a regular basis. It's the foundation for growth and insight, and it also provides maintenance time for our brain.
>
> It's not healthy to remove all solitude from your life by glancing at your phone at every possible moment of boredom -- it leads to anxiety and can impede your development.
